Captive Green
=============

This theme is based on FreeCSSTemplates.org's [Captive Green template](http://www.freecsstemplates.org/preview/captivegreen/)

This is a two-column, fixed-width design with dark color scheme for Drupal 7.


Caveats
-------

Currently the theme prints site name and slogan without any gaps. It is needed because on the site where 
I using this theme the site name is the name part of the domain and the slogan is the TLD to be able 
colorize it differently with the span element. 
If you do not want this behavior, simply remove the slogan printing or place to where you want.
